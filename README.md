# Fashion-MNIST-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks for classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using Pytorch and Tensorflow.

This repository contains implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using both PyTorch and TensorFlow. 

The network architecture for both networks can be customized to match specific performance requirements. Currently, the networks features the following layers:

- 2D Convolutional layers
- 2D Max Pooling layers
- Dropout layers
- Dense/Linear layers

# Usage

Pytorch or Tensorflow must be installed to run their respective implementations.

After Pytorch or Tensorflow has been installed, the corresponding script can be run to automatically download the Fashion-MNIST dataset and start the model's training process
